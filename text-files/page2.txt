But our bunch didn't know. Two brothers were left, and when they died, it was difficult to have them buried, because they weren't registered. At that time, people were afraid to register boys; girls were registered, but not boys. Because they were caught as children and taken to the army.

What year was that, Ma?

I don't know, it wasn't during my time. I'm telling you, it was Grandpa's brother, my Mother's father's brother, so you can figure out when that must have been. I suppose, maybe in the 1800s. or maybe the 1700s. I remember the other Uncle, but he was an old man, and when we came he used to tell -- What will be, he used to say, when I will die? What will they do with me? I remember when he died. Ma went and Pa went. I don't know what they did, whether they paid someone or what. They weren't registered at birth, so there was no proof they had lived. So they couldn't die. In Yiddish, at the Rabbi's, he was registered. In the small towns it was done. Buried and finished.

Weren't there those who went to tell?

Nonsense, they never went out of the house. What did he do? He taught, he had a Cheder there, and that's the way it was.

So, there was a General, and he died. His name was different, Russian, but they looked for the Dvochbovna family. A lawyer would have cost a great deal.

And the Dvochbovna was????

He was a brother to my Mother's father, Moishe. You were named after him.

Bobbe's name was Dvochbovna?

Yes. When Laizer came to America, he was called Bobbin. From Dvochbovna. Could they say Dvochbovna? So he said Bobbin.

When Isaac came over here he was about 18 years old. He came to the States. My father had a sister in Philadelphia. So he went straight there and he was at the Aunts' two years. Until he had to appear before the draft, when he had to go to the army.

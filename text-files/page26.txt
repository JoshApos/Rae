place for him here, and he doesn't have to go anywhere.

But we were hungry, and there was nothing to eat. They would give a
piece of bread, some Kashe, and we would cook it. A half pound of
bread for each person, not fresh bread, and it was heavy like a rock.

I used to walk among the peasants to see if I could get bread. I forgot
to tell you that. In Moscow there were little children amongst our
bunch. They were crying, they wanted to eat. The big ones ate what they
could, but the young ones cried they were hungry. So I and another
woman, there were two of us, we went outinto the country - we had a
piece of soap with us. If you had a piece of soap... So we went into a
peasant's house and asked if we could get some bread. Ourselves we have
no bread. How about we give you a piece of soap? O ya, for a piece of
soap they'll find bread. What kind of bread did they find?

I shared a room with Ma, and Shy with Morry. Shy used to knock on the

door - Wake up! It's a holiday, and we have to go and eat. Of course,

on the boat our health improved. They fed Ma bacon. She didn't know
what it was. They told her it was Griveness. Morry told her it was
kosher. See that man with the beard, he told her? He's a Rabbi. Since
we were a large family, they sat us all at the same table, and Morry
told her it was because they were feeding us kosher food. When we got
to Winnipeg, she went looking for the Griveness. THen Morry told her

there we moved to ......something like here in Kensington...it's on
the tip of my tongue......, But we had a nice house - 5 rooms. It was
a pleasure. You entered and there was a chair to sit on - that was
already a pleasure. It was a rocking chair. WHen I sat on it, it was
like sitting in the Kaiser's palace.

This is the end of the first part of Ma's recording of her experiences

getting out of Russia. Now she's going to tell us about the town that
they lived in in Russia.

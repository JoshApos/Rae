home and I didn't know how to start. How do I make a_ beginning. So
Sherman was beside me and he said - so make a finish. And you think I
didnâ€™t? I made a finish. Where there was supposed to be a cross, I

made a bendele, and started working from there. I understood that here
I had to darfn aropgein mit a shpitz, un ich bob gekrift un dcgekrift,
un ich hob geton azoi vi er hot gehaisn. Understand? How do I start to
"make it? My mother used to say that she used to make all kinds of
things, but to tell me how, she couldn't. She didn't work for years and

made wheels - she had two sons. One was a fardoznik(?) a painter of

And when I came in there, I saw her, the old woman, her name was Yonte-

8.

So I went there. There were armed soldiers at the entrance. One of them took a look at me, a girl barefoot and dressed in a sack, and said to me, where do you think you're going? I want to see Madam Rabek. What, you want to see Madam Rabek? I want to talk to her. He says No, and starts yelling at me. And I shout louder.

It so happened that she was sitting across the hall, writing, and she heard us. In Russian, she said, What's the matter? Since I was already on the inside, I answered her directly. She told me to come in, so I felt relieved. If she asked me to come into the room?

Who are you, and where do you come from?

She was a Russian, and powerful. But a woman is different. Listen, she
said to me, I'll give you my signature, but you still have to cross Finland. There are consuls that have to give you a transit visa. It's up to him. If he's a good man, he'll give it to you. I'll give you my signature.

I was told that her visa had to be the first one, and she gave it to me.

So I asked her where would I find the Latvian Consul. She gave me the address, and I went there. He was a Chalerieh, and antiâ€“semite like you've never seen. As soon as he saw me come in, he said "Zhidovka? Where are you going?" I don't have a land, so where could I be going? So I answered, I'm going to America, and you have to give me a visa.

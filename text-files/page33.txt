impossible to warm up. They went up on the deck and saw the iceberg. Mother was beside herself at that time.

Tell me again about the family, Faige, Chaya feige

Yeh, Chaya Feige, your Grandfather's mother.

How far back do you know? Grandpa's father?

My Father's father was called Isaac, Froym Isaac. Isaac was named after him. I was named after Father's mother. When her husband died, she came to live with us. They lived near Umin, a long way from us. She told Mother she wouldn't be with us long, because she had come to die. She had no one left there, so she came to be with her son. Mother said she wasn't there long before she died. I never knew her.

Father was born in Umin, where Mime Manye lived. She was 12 years old when Isaac was born. Her step mother said Mother should take care of her. She (stepmother) had no children of her own when she married, and none until 10 years later. Manye was my mother's siter.

My grandmother ?? had two brothers that lived. I remember an Uncle Avrom. There were two other brothers, but they were taken to the Army when they were 8 years old. One was the General; of the other one, we knew nothing. The General came from a religious family, and they put him in the cloister. Inwardly, he knew who he was.

Go back to Bobbe's family.

My grandfather, Ma's father, died a year after his wife died. His name was Moishe.

And your Bobbe's nomen?

That I don't remember. She died long before, so it was as if we had no grandmother. After all, Mime Manye was from another wife. Mime Manye, Uncle Lazer, Uncle Mayer and Mime Esther - four children born to another mother. That was Mother's father; their name I don't remember. But my mother took in Mime Manye and Mime Ester into her home. She said she would keep them with her. Mime Chaya Feige was also a sister, but she didn't want to take them in. Mother told her to take the boys, they would help with the work, and she would take the girls. She would marry them off, and that's the way it was.

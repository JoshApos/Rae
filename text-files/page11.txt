pail. I weighed all of 80 pounds then. Never you mind, I said, I'll pick up the pail all right. Nobody else offered to go and wash the floors. I went into the office and saw that it was empty. But I see a bunch of papers on the desk. What can we do with those papers? I also sent in a prozeni - a request. I looked through the pile and saw that mine was on the bottom. I quickly turned over the pile, and lo and behold, mine was now on the top! And I remain sitting; no washing the floor. Then the man came in and sat at the desk. He took a look at me, and smiled. He understood that I was Jewish. So was he. He was a commandant, an officer.

Why are you sitting, he asks me? Sure, I came here to clean, so why am I sitting? What do you think, I asked him; do you think I am capable of picking up this pail? Whether you can or not, I'll help you, and he carried the pail into the room I was supposed to mop. Do the best you can.

Where is your prozeni? I sent it in yesterday. When were you brought in? Yesterday. Where is it? Must be on the desk. That's funny, you only sent it in yesterday, and it's already on top of the pile. He laughed. Why did they bring you in, you must have done something? I was afraid to tell him about selling the apples; the punishment for that was terrible. I said that I had a few apples with me, the boys were hungry, so they ate them. And so, he said, when you came in, you had nothing on you? They saw nothing on you when you were brought in? No, they saw only an empty basket. Then I told him that we were due to leave the next day, and that my mother was waiting outside the prison. I also told him about Sherman. I'll give you the permit, and tomorrow you'll be free to go. That's how I got out of there.

We get to the border, and back we go gain.

Back to Petrograd, and to the office. They sent me where the soldiers were, to the barracks. Go back there and wait. They thought we were coming back from America so they prepared a special dinner for us.

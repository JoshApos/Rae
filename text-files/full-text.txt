Ma
Zelda? She should tell the story of his heritage? As if she knows. How would Zelda know? Zelda knows she had an Auntie Leah. What does Zelda know?

Morry
Who told you about that, Ma?

Zelda told me she got a letter - he wants to know something about -- to me he didn't write - to Esther, with Sid's Esther he corresponds.

Morry
Boomie? Boomie, yeh. But Sylvia says she doesn't hear from him. She hears nothing, she says. He doesn't write and she doesn't hear from him.

Morry
Esther might tell him stories about Bobbe, and this and that. I suppose Sylvia probably doesn't tell. It's not talked about.

Sonya didn't know about such things, and I believe Zelda also didn't know. Zelda didn't know anything about what went on there - how her mother came and from where she came. I know a lot because Pa, may he rest in peace, and Ma, used to talk about what happened in the old country. One time, there arrived - it appeared in the paper, that they are searching for the Dvochbovna. A general died, and they are looking for the Dvochbovna family. If anyone of that name should read this, they should respond. And Uncle Laizer - his name was Dvochbovna - Ma's brother - sorry, her Uncle, not a brother. Mother had two uncles, and four brothers of grandfather's. Two of them were caught when they were 8 years old and taken to the Army. One of the two became a General. He didn't know where he came from - he was only 8 years old then - but he thought there must have been something, a fight. But he didn't know what. But he knew that his name was  Dvochbovna. So Laizer went looking but couldn't find anything. If there had been money to pay a lawyer, they would have searched and found who he is. There were those that were actually found, and it turned out they left a great fortune. But our bunch didn't know. Two brothers were left, and when they died, it was difficult to have them buried, because they weren't registered. At that time, people were afraid to register boys; girls were registered, but not boys. Because they were caught as children and taken to the army.

What year was that, Ma?

I don't know, it wasn't during my time. I'm telling you, it was Grandpa's brother, my Mother's father's brother, so you can figure out when that must have been. I suppose, maybe in the 1800s. or maybe the 1700s. I remember the other Uncle, but he was an old man, and when we came he used to tell -- What will be, he used to say, when I will die? What will they do with me? I remember when he died. Ma went and Pa went. I don't know what they did, whether they paid someone or what. They weren't registered at birth, so there was no proof they had lived. So they couldn't die. In Yiddish, at the Rabbi's, he was registered. In the small towns it was done. Buried and finished.

Weren't there those who went to tell?

Nonsense, they never went out of the house. What did he do? He taught, he had a Cheder there, and that's the way it was.

So, there was a General, and he died. His name was different, Russian, but they looked for the Dvochbovna family. A lawyer would have cost a great deal.

And the Dvochbovna was????

He was a brother to my Mother's father, Moishe. You were named after him.

Bobbe's name was Dvochbovna?

Yes. When Laizer came to America, he was called Bobbin. From Dvochbovna. Could they say Dvochbovna? So he said Bobbin.

When Isaac came over here he was about 18 years old. He came to the States. My father had a sister in Philadelphia. So he went straight there and he was at the Aunts' two years. Until he had to appear before the draft, when he had to go to the army. Pa would have to pay $500 if he didn't show up, and Pa didn't have any $500 to pay. So he came home. He was altogether two years in the States. He saved $500 there and came back to Russia with the money. But he didn't want to give up the money. He was short, not tall enough, so he thought they wouldn't take him. He came home, and Mother tried to make him fat, so that in the end he was wider than tall. She fed him butter and milk. So they examined him and let him go. He was with us about 6 months, and then he went back. After 6 months there, he sent for Pa. He was 21 when he went back; it was the time the Titanic went down, you remember? He was supposed to go on the Titanic, but it was over-reserved. He couldn't get on it, so he took another boat. When this boat got to the place where the Titanic went down, they could still see the iceberg. He wrote us that it was very cold, but the Captain asked everybody to go up on deck, and they could see the iceberg in the distance. They were dressed in readiness to jump into the sea should anything happen. It was a few months later, but the iceberg was still on the water.

Six months after Pa left, we sold the house. Where we worked, was also
like a small house, so we made two rooms out of it and sold it, too. And with this money, the whole family started out. Moiseh, Sid, Shy, I and Mother. Mother had two sisters, and since their Mother was in America, they had no money for the trip. Mother wouldn't leave her sisters behind, and she had enough money from the sale of the house to take them along. In the end, they went and we were turned back. The Mime Manya and the Mime Esther. Manya you remember, but not Esther. They turned us back because of Sherman - they wouldn't let him on the Ship. Pa was in America with Isaac, so we couldn't do anything about it.

They wouldn't let us on the boat because America wouldn't take in a
blind person, so the Captain wouldn't let him on the ship. Mother
wanted Moishe to go, but he said, who would stay here with us? Sherman
was only 6 years old, and Sid was 8 years old. (It took another nine years) And then, the war and the revolution broke out. We couldn't receive any letters. We didn't have anything to live on.
About two years after we were turned back, Morris went. He managed to get out just before the war started. If he hadn't left, he would also have been in the army. He said that the three in America — Pa, Isaac, and he — would then be able to send for the rest of the family. They managed to work something out — they got an affidavit from the government that although he, Sherman, was blind, as long as he had no disease in his eyes, they would let him come in.

All the papers arrived, and we could have gone, but the revolution had started and no one could leave. Money we didn't have; they didn't know where we were, and we didn't know where they were. But somehow, I remembered the address. Actually, it was on all the mail, but when the bandits came in, they tore up all the cushions looking for money. Everything was torn up and thrown out and I had nothing to show. When we came to the boat we had nothing to show, but they examined Sherman. I guess it must have been luck. The doctors that examined Sherman were very nice. They sat and talked to him. Whatever they asked him, he asked back. So they said he was an exceptional boy. He won't get lost even if he's blind.

What happened during the time when you first couldn't get on the ship because of Sherman, and the time you did manage to get on?

It took nine whole years! When Sherman came here he was 14 years old.

So what year was it when you all came over here?

1921. In 1913, just before the war, we returned to Russia, to Korsun. We were supposed to take the ship in Germany, in Hamburg. If we had gone as we should have, it would have been from Hamburg, in Misslevitch, I remember. From there to England, where we would take the large ship to America, to Canada.

Did you get to Hamburg? The first time, sure, we even got to Berlin. There was a committee there, and we thought maybe they could do something for us, but they couldn't. So we returned to Russia, to Oshana, but we stopped in Korsun where Mime Chai Feige lived.

Ah, so before you started coming here, you live in Oshana?

Ya.

Was that also in the Ukraine?

Ya, in the Ukraine.

And when you went back you stayed in Korsun?

It's not far, about 25 miles from where we lived. Also a small town. And from Kiev it was overnight by train - not far from Kiev. So when the war started and we didn't have anything to show - no, wait, that was not the war, that was the revolution already. If it wasn't for the revolution, we wouldn't have been able to start out. We didn't have money; we didn't have anything to go by train with. When the revolution started, you could go any place. If the train ran, anyone could jump on and go. There were no bosses, no authority. Wherever there was a little band of soldiers, of bandits, so they started to run the train and you went wherever they wanted to go — the communists, sure, so they started to run the train. When we got on we rode for about 30 miles, and then it stopped. We were sitting on the platforms. It wasn't closed cars - the ones they run freight. We sat for about 10 days before they put another engine to it and they pulled us a little further. It took us a year to get to Moscow.

We got into Moscow. We didn't have anything and it was in December - very cold there - about 40 below. And I didn't have any shoes, and I made a pair from rags. With spools from cotton I made the heels. That's how I walked. We didn't have anything to eat so what could we do. So I went out to the market to see what I can try. So I bought some apples, and we were sitting near the barracks. We had a couch; the family had a couch. We were sleeping on that couch and eating on that couch. There were bandits in the barracks, not soldiers. But the Germans were still there. The Russians fought the Germans till they drove them out, and when they left, anybody who got hold of a gun became a big shot.

So we didn't have any papers. There was no place to go in and take a paper saying we were so many and who we were. So I made up a paper myself; Mother's age, my age, Shy's. There was a set-up there already, so I went in, asked him to sign it, he put his stamp on it, and that was it. That's how we got out.

When we got to Moscow, they looked at the paper. "What have you got here? You have nothing here. Where are you from? Who are you? What are you? Where are you going?" "We are going to America." He laughed at me. "What are you going to do there?" "We have by family there." Now, that's a different story. We'll see what we can do. They were the
Vecheka - like the KGB. And once you were in there, you were afraid you would never get out of there.

"Vecheka" is a Russian word?

A Russian word - I don't recall what it meant, but it was the new leadership. If you can go into the Vecheka, you can get a visa. So how do you get into the Vecheka? And I can see a mob of people standing there. We weren't the only ones who wanted to go; the whole world was running and travelling to hell and gone. This one was going to America, that one to wherever. We were six families from our town. There was a family that came back to visit their parents, got stuck there and couldn't go back. And there were families where the husbands were in America so that he shouldn't have to go to war. From the dowry and from the few dollars the bride had, he ran away and she remained behind. Those were the kind of couples - we were about ten families travelling together, all sitting together at the station. We didn't know them, we simply gathered together. After all, I was alone with Mother and Sherman.

And with Sid?

No, Sid was here by then.

Then this was the second time?

Yes, the second time. Sid left just at the start of the revolution. We left later. We had to wait for the fare.

How did Sid get away?

Well, he was a barber. He learned the trade. He'll come here, what will he do? He'll be a barber, so he'll have something to do. And he was short; he couldn't reach the people to give the haircuts so he was standing on a chair. But he was a good barber, and all the big shots that were officers before the trouble, the revolution, they liked him and went to him for haircuts. Then he started working on them - he wants to go to America. How can you fix it for me to go? So they told him - Come, we'll get you onto the train, and you'll go. They actually gave him a pass, a pass he should be able to get to the border. After the border, he would be clear. So that's how he went. He came back - it didn't take him as long as it took us. He didn't travel alone, he went with Mime Manya, and with Sonya. (Esther went earlier, not Manya?)

Eizik had sent money to Sonya from America. In those times we were still getting money from America. With that money Sonya bought a ticket. Sid also got money, and they left on the train. They travelled through Japan. Sid and Sonya were in Japan. It took them about 5 months to get there.

But it took us two years. So we came to Moscow - Mother, Shy, and myself. The others, the ten families, were also there, and none of us could get away. I was the first one to get a visa. I used to go every day, trying to get a pass to get out of there. I went in there; there were a few Jews sitting and writing. A Jew you could recognize. I looked at one I thought was Jewish, so I said something to him in Yiddish and saw that he understood what I said. Then I spoke to him in Russian, told him we were left all alone, the whole whole story, how it happened and what happened, that we're alone and we want to get across, and all I have is this paper. That, he said, you can throw it away, that's nothing. But at least, I know their names, I said, and that's something. OK, he said, and wrote something on the paper. He said - if you can get into the Vecheka, try to see Madam Rabek. Go and see Madam Rabek. (I still remember the name!)

So I went there. There were armed soldiers at the entrance. One of them took a look at me, a girl barefoot and dressed in a sack, and said to me, where do you think you're going? I want to see Madam Rabek. What, you want to see Madam Rabek? I want to talk to her. He says No, and starts yelling at me. And I shout louder.

It so happened that she was sitting across the hall, writing, and she heard us. In Russian, she said, What's the matter? Since I was already on the inside, I answered her directly. She told me to come in, so I felt relieved. If she asked me to come into the room?

Who are you, and where do you come from?

She was a Russian, and powerful. But a woman is different. Listen, she
said to me, I'll give you my signature, but you still have to cross Finland. There are consuls that have to give you a transit visa. It's up to him. If he's a good man, he'll give it to you. I'll give you my signature.

I was told that her visa had to be the first one, and she gave it to me.

So I asked her where would I find the Latvian Consul. She gave me the address, and I went there. He was a Chalerieh, and anti–semite like you've never seen. As soon as he saw me come in, he said "Zhidovka? Where are you going?" I don't have a land, so where could I be going? So I answered, I'm going to America, and you have to give me a visa.

I don't have to. If I want to, I can give you a visa, he said. He held us up a whole year. If you're not giving me the visa this time, I said, I'm bringing my mother and my brother here, and do whatever you want. You can feed us. You can see my position - how I am. And my mother, she's barefooted too, like I am, and if you don't want, you feed us. And I left. When I got home and they saw me, those that travelled with us, they asked - Where did you get those papers? There was one that had returned, had an affidavit from the States; she didn't have to wait, but she didn't know. She said she had some papers from America. Give me the papers, I said, and we'll see what you have there. A man who was standing nearby said he could read English. I recognized the stamp. It
was like the one we had from Sherman. I went with her and worked everything out for her. She left before me. She was travelling with three other girls. I believe one of them was American born, and that's why she had the paper. She had a child there, and so they couldn't keep her. They left. We all exchanged addresses, so that we could stay in contact with each other when necessary.

And that's the address my father found in the newspapers from New York – no, sorry, he saw it in the Yiddish paper. He used to read the Forwards. She placed the notice in the Forwards. "Anybody knowing the whereabouts of” - she didn't know if he was in Canada or where. When Pa saw it, he called all the kids together, and told them that Mother was in Moscow. By that time, we were in Petrograd.

And did you get the papers you needed in Latvia?

Sure. I said to him - why are you sitting here? I'm here for the people that want to go to Latvia. That's what I want. I don't want anything from you, I'm not going to stay in Latvia. I'm going past Latvia - just let me in through Latvia. You've got to give me that, that's what you're here for. If you don't give it to me, I said, you're an anti-Semite. It's because I'm Jewish, thats why you don't want to give me a visa. If you don't, I'll bring you the family. So he did - To get rid of you I'll give you the visa.

And what to do now? How do we move from here? We get to the border, and

How did you get to Petrograd from there?

are turned back, with the paper and everything. And then I got a letter from Canada.

On the platforms - from one place to the other. It took months to get from Moscow to Petrograd. The whole trip should take about 2 hours travel time; it took us about 3-4 weeks.

There, I sold apples. We had to eat, too. My God, it's a long story! And then they caught me with the apples. We were ready to leave, had all the papers, everything was fine. I still had a few apples to sell at the market, although selling was forbidden. I'm caught and taken to jail. Soldiers are standing there. I had, I guess, about six or seven apples with me, and I said - Boys, have an apple. By the time I came into the jail, I had an empty basket; no more apples. The first man inside asked me why I was brought in. I don't know, I said. I was walking in the market, looking for something to buy, when they picked me up. They picked you up with and empty basket?, he laughed.

Of course, the soldiers were hungry, so they ate. I knew there would be
no apples left, so why arrest me? The jail was full. On the walls was written "smiet, hebreyen speculantn" (Death to Jewish speculators).

I, of course, am a Yidisher speculant. I'm inside, locked in, and Mother is left outside. Once inside, the others told me - Sit down, make yourself comfortable, you'll be here a long time. And I said, no, we have to leave here. This one says she's been here six months, another a year. And why is she there? Who knows? They probably caught her with a bun or something. Why is she sitting such a long time? Because you have to send in a prozini - explaining why she was apprehended, what crime she committed. And that can take years! But I said, I've got to go, I can't sit here. I have travel papers; I've been on the move for 2 years. I'm supposed to leave tomorrow.

All right, we'll see what will be. Meanwhile, a soldier comes in and
asks who is ready to clean the office. Right away, I said I would. He
took a look at me, and said - you? You won't be able to pick up the

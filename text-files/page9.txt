I don't have to, if I want to,I can give you a viza, he said. He held
us up a whole year. If your not giving me the viza this time, I said,
I'm bringing my mother and my brother here, and do whatever you want.
You can feed us. You can see my position- how I am. And my mother,
she'sbarefooted too, like I am, and if you don't want, you feed _ us.
And I left.When I got home and they saw me, those that travelled with
us, they asked-WHere did you get those papers? There was one that had
returned had an affidavit from the States; she didn't have to wait,
but she didn't know. She said she had some papers from America. Give me
the papers, I said, and we'll see what you have there. A man who was
Standing nearby said he could read English. I recognized the stamp. It
was like the one we had from Sherman. I went with her and worked
everything out for her. She left before me. She was travelling with 3
other girls. I believe one of them was American born, and that's why
she had the paper. She had a child there, and so they couldn't keep
her. They left. We all exchanged addresses, so that we could stay in
contact with each other when necessary.

And that's the address my father found in the newspapers from New
York, No-sorry, he saw it in the Yiddish paper. He used to read the
Forwards. She placed the notice in the Forwards. "Anybody knowing the
whereabouts of‚Äù -She didn't know if he was in Canada or where. When Pa
Saw it, he called all the kids together, and told them that Mother was
in Moscow. By that time, we were in Petrograd.

And did you get the papers you needed in Latvia?

Sure. I said to him - why are you sitting here? I"m here for the
people that want to _ go to Latvia. That's what I want. I dont want
anything from you, I"m not going to stay in Latvia. I"m going past
Latvia - just let me in thro Latvia. You"ve got to give me that, that's
what you'r here for. If you don't give it to me, I said, you'r an
antisemite. It''s because I'm Jewish, thats why you don't want to give
me a viza. If you don't, I'll bring you the family. So he did - To get
rid of you I'll give you the viza.

And what to do now? How do we move from here? We get to the border, and

How did you get to Petrograd from there?

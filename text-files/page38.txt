38.

Brushke eventually left with her husband and a child. The child spoke French, or maybe Spanish when they visited us. We couldn't tell. To me he seemed like a Frenchman - anyway, a Jew. She had a boy either the first or second child, a number of girls, and finally another boy. She had a Becky, and a Rochel (we were named after grandmother), and a Moishe. Those kind of names. They were a lovely family, and now nobody knows what has become of them. While we lived on Robert St., there was a visitor from there to the family who lived across from us. I actually went in there and showed her the picture. She said she did not recognize the picture, but did I have a name? Maybe if I had remembered his name, she might have known him. Who knows.

Isaac met Elka in Philadelphia. She came from Poland to be with a sister, two sisters I believe. She was probably already no baby, so her sisters looked for a match for her. Walking by, Isaac saw her sitting on the verandah, and said that she would be his wife. I don't know how they met. Elka used to tell the story that he would come holding his hat, not knowing where to put it, so he just stood and held it. She always told that story.

He returned to Winnipeg; he was there when we arrived. At that time, Mary was 6 months old and Sylvia about 2 1/2. They were both born in the States, and Chavele and Boomie in Winnipeg.

Morry married Clara in Chicago, and Sid married Esther from western Canada. Sid was a young man. He had a store in the country. He had a group of friends who knew the Hoffers, and they arranged the meeting with Esther. He had prettier girls, but I guess she was the destined one.

Tell me about Rose's family.

The story Rose told me. I was already married when they came to live with Ma. They lived in the country. Their father came alone. He didn't want to have anything to do with his wife and children. He married a non-Jew, a German. Rose's mother died on the way over. There was no family connection whatsoever. Ma took them in because they were orphans. Sherman left for Brantford, so Sid was the only one who lived home at the time. Mother had 3 bedrooms there, so the girls had a room for themselves. Sara must have been about 18 or 19, and Rose about 16. Their brother Jack was also there for a short while. He left to someplace or other, and I didn't hear from him again until he married.

Ma
Zelda? She should tell the story of his heritage? As if she knows. How would Zelda know? Zelda knows she had an Auntie Leah. What does Zelda know?

Morry
Who told you about that, Ma?

Zelda told me she got a letter - he wants to know something about -- to me he didn't write - to Esther, with Sid's Esther he corresponds.

Morry
Boomie? Boomie, yeh. But Sylvia says she doesn't hear from him. She hears nothing, she says. He doesn't write and she doesn't hear from him.

Morry
Esther might tell him stories about Bobbe, and this and that. I suppose Sylvia probably doesn't tell. It's not talked about.

Sonya didn't know about such things, and I believe Zelda also didn't know. Zelda didn't know anything about what went on there - how her mother came and from where she came. I know a lot because Pa, may he rest in peace, and Ma, used to talk about what happened in the old country. One time, there arrived - it appeared in the paper, that they are searching for the Dvochbovna. A general died, and they are looking for the Dvochbovna family. If anyone of that name should read this, they should respond. And Uncle Laizer - his name was Dvochbovna - Ma's brother - sorry, her Uncle, not a brother. Mother had two uncles, and four brothers of grandfather's. Two of them were caught when they were 8 years old and taken to the Army. One of the two became a General. He didn't know where he came from - he was only 8 years old then - but he thought there must have been something, a fight. But he didn't know what. But he knew that his name was  Dvochbovna. So Laizer went looking but couldn't find anything. If there had been money to pay a lawyer, they would have searched and found who he is. There were those that were actually found, and it turned out they left a great fortune.

like baseball. I remember the first time Moishe and I went on a_ train.
When we came back, the whole town was in our yard. And Morry showed
them how the train ran on the rails. And you sit here and you didn't
even know that you were driving. There were people sitting there -

"It's like a house - you don't even feel that you're moving!

I was about 6 years old at the time that -happened. I was after a
sickness - we went to a wedding. That neice of my mothers was married

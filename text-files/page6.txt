There was a set-up there already, so I went in, asked him to sign it,

he put his stamp on it, and that was it. That's how we got out.

When we got to Moscow, they looked at the paper. "What have you got
here? You have nothing here. Where are you from? WHo are you? What are
you? Where are you going?" "We are going to America." He laughed at
me. "What are you going to do there?" "We have by family there." NOw,
that's a different story. We'll see what we can do. They were the
V.CHa.Ka - like the KGB. And once you were in there, you were afraid

you would never get out of there.

Va.CHa.Ka is a Russian word? A Russian word - I don't recall what it
meant, but it was the new leadership. If you can go into the VaChaKa
you can get a visa. So how do you get into the VaCHaKa? And I can see
a mob of people standing there. We weren't the only ones who wanted to
go; the whole world was running and travelling to hell and gone. This
one was going to America, that one to wherever. We were 6 families from
our town. There was a family that came back to visit their parents, got
stuck there and couldn't go back. And there were families where the
husbands were in America so that he shouldn't have to go to war. From
the dowry and from the few dollars the bride had, he ran away and she
remained behind. Those were the kind of couples - we _ were about 10
families travelling together, all sitting together at the station. We
didn't know them, we simply gathered together. After all, I was alone
with Mother and Sherman.

And with Sid?
No, Sid was here by then.
THen this was the second time?

Yes, the second time. Sid left just at the start of the revolution.
We left later. We had to wait for the fare.

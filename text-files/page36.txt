Canadian - they were worth the same then. So Mother had a lot of money. Uncle Velvl, Sonya's father, asked her why she kept so much money with her, and offered to take the money and "work" with it. She gave it to him and he worked with it.

When we got to Winnipeg, Mime Manya already had given birth to Velvl. She had no children before coming here. The husbands came straight to Canada, they didn't go to Winnipeg to the States where Isaac was. They were there a few years before we came. They made good money, and put it in the bank. Eventually, the bank went bust. They had no money, Father had no money. Isaac and Morry also had their money there, so there was no one to go to
for help. That's when we arrived. Father used to say he was. saving for me, for a dowry for me. He thought it was still in Oshana where you needed a dowry. Anyway, the money was all gone - no more money.

While we were in Russia, my Father wrote this little song he used to sing

to himself. Sing it for you? Can I sing now? OK, I'll try.

With no one to talk to but myself,
Lost in a strange land,
You alone, my God, brought me to this state, (he always talked to God)
The power to bless or to damn is in God's hand
The creator of the universe,
It is written in his wise book
that I should be separated from my own.

There were a few more verses I can't recall, and then the last:

My God, it's no longer early, winter is coming,
Bring me together with my wife and children.

He sang this song constantly until we arrived.

After they went broke, what did Zaide do?

He worked for himself; always in the cooperage business. All his life. In Russia, he used to go into the forest, buy lumber, the Goyin would split

So, Mother and Mime Chaya Feige were from your grandfather's first wife,
and all the rest from the second wife. Mother said they were her sisters
and she took care of them. If one of them had an argument with her
husband, she ran to Mother. She would stay two to three weeks, and then

Uncle left for America, after Isaac; and to Philadelphia, too. Mime
Manye was left alone. He didn't have work: he was a painter. When Isaac

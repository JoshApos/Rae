But later, before we went, they started to put on tin. At that time, I was about 10 years old already. I remember, across our street, somebody built a house. I saw the way they built it. They built a nice real big house. Ours just had a bedroom, a front room and a kitchen.

How did they get the two houses?

Most likely they bought it. Father must have bought it, he didn't build it. I don't remember how, I just remember that I was born there.

And all the years there he was a barrel maker.

He was a barrel maker and he worked in that other little house. It was like a workshop, a place to work in. There was no stove there, no windows, just a place where the people used to work.

And the workers used to sleep there?

No, that was a different one. This was attached to the house - In the back like was a little house, one big room and a kitchen, we used to keep that for Pesach. My mother kept it just for Pesach, it was a Pesachdiker kitchen. She didn't touch it all year. The other one was just like a barn, it was closed in, and when father went away, and there was nobody there working, we sold it, and the people that bought it made it like a house. We sold it with the ground naturally, it was a big place with apples and cherries and whatever not - everything. Vegetables and everything. Whenever mother was going to cook she would send out the kids to go and bring in potatoes or anything. I remember once I went out and I broke the knife and I was afraid to go into the house, but to father I ran, into the place where he worked and I said I broke the knife. Sit here and wait until dinner time. By the time we have to go in to eat, Ma will forget about it. But I was afraid to go in. She didn't forget. When I came in she said Where have you been hiding?

What kind of games did the kids play?

The kids played with a ball,

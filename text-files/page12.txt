The kitchen crew made fresh buns with chicken - a banquet. They thought we had come from America! If we crossed the border, then we must have come from America, They were out to show us how wonderful it was in Russia, so they made us a feast. And Sherman, you can imagine ! When he heard that, he started working on all the soldiers. He presented himself as an American. Everything said would immediately be forwarded to America, he told them. It was a regular picnic! By the second day, they found us out.

Now, where was I? Oh yes. We got a letter from Morry that he is coming to get us. But we couldn't get out on account of Sherman. He couldn't and we couldn't either. So I called him back and I told him - Don't you dare come into Russia. Stay there, because I have all my papers and I can get across to Riga.

How did you let him know?

I called, on the phone, from the office. I showed them his letter that he's there and he wants to come in. Did I have a time of it! What to do with Morry? Never mind, I told him, stay there. And he did. We went across and he was right there, at the station. When the train came to the Riga border, Morry was there.

Did he come from the States to Riga?

Sure. He came from Canada. So he was standing waiting for us, there was a gate there. They wouldn't let him go through to see us, but he managed to shove a few dollars into my hand. How did you get through, I asked him? He said he had a passport. Back we went by train, we went by first class, in a compartment special for us. In Latvia a Yid was not supposed to get out there. We were locked in from one train to the other. And that's how we got to London.

Once in London, we thought we would be allowed to board the ship, but we were stopped on account of him, they wanted to examine Sherman. We didn't have any papers for him. So the doctors spoke to him, and they all gave him a pass. We waited in London 8 days until our ship was due to leave. We travelled first class!

are turned back, with the paper and everything. And then I got a

letter from Canada.
On the platforms- from one place to the other. It took months to get

from Moscow to Petrograd. THe whole trip should take about 2 hours
travel time; it took us about 3-4 weeks.

There, I sold apples. We had to eat, too. My God, it's a long story!
And then they caught me with the apples. We were ready to leave, had

all the papers, everything was fine. I still had afew apples to sell
at the market, although selling was forbidden. I'm caught and taken to
jail. Soldiers are standing there. I had, I guess, about 6-7 apple

with me, and I said - Boys, have an apple. By the time I came into the

you have to send in a prozini - explaining why she was apprehended,
what crime she committed. And that can take years! But I said, I've
got to go, I can't sit here. I have travel papers; I've been onthe
move for 2 years. I'm supposed to leave tomorrow.

All right, we'll see waht will be. Meanwhile, a soldier comes in and
asks who is ready to clean the office. Right away, I said I would. He

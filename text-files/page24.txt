everybody could go to school, so I registered, too.

But what did you do before that? Before that, I forgot to tell you. In

 

Oshana. Father worked for the (pritsim), the important ones, the
teachers, a doctor. When they would put up watermelons, pickles, and
Whoever

so on, to sour, they used to call him. They liked my father.
he wants to send to school, they'll take in. I was the one they could

send to school, because the boys worked with my father. They didn't go

to the regular school, they went to Cheder. Moishe went to CHeder and

he knew more than those who went to school. Isaac too, but he wasn't as
good a student. Before you couldâ€™ turn around, Moishe already knew
everything. The Rebbe came to see my father; if Moishe would only want

do what you think is right. So, on Shabbes, we had to write exams, and
I told my father that I wanted to do what the Rabbi's daughter will do.
He said that if the Rabbi lets her go, then I can go too. And that's
how it was. We went together, and we both passed. THe few other Jewish

kids had to stop because they wouldn't write on Shabat.

I went to school till the fourth grade. Then the bandits came in, and
no more teaching, no more school. By the way, you remember when I came
to Israel by boat and met the insurance man and his wife? She took
courses, which means that she went to school in the evening. It was

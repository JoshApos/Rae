About two years after we were turned back, Morris went. He managed to get out just before the war started. If he hadn't left, he would also have been in the army. He said that the three in America — Pa, Isaac, and he — would then be able to send for the rest of the family. They managed to work something out — they got an affidavit from the government that although he, Sherman, was blind, as long as he had no disease in his eyes, they would let him come in.

All the papers arrived, and we could have gone, but the revolution had started and no one could leave. Money we didn't have; they didn't know where we were, and we didn't know where they were. But somehow, I remembered the address. Actually, it was on all the mail, but when the bandits came in, they tore up all the cushions looking for money. Everything was torn up and thrown out and I had nothing to show. When we came to the boat we had nothing to show, but they examined Sherman. I guess it must have been luck. The doctors that examined Sherman were very nice. They sat and talked to him. Whatever they asked him, he asked back. So they said he was an exceptional boy. He won't get lost even if he's blind.

What happened during the time when you first couldn't get on the ship because of Sherman, and the time you did manage to get on?

It took nine whole years! When Sherman came here he was 14 years old.

So what year was it when you all came over here?

1921. In 1913, just before the war, we returned to Russia, to Korsun. We were supposed to take the ship in Germany, in Hamburg. If we had gone as we should have, it would have been from Hamburg, in Misslevitch, I remember. From there to England, where we would take the large ship to America, to Canada.

Did you get to Hamburg? The first time, sure, we even got to Berlin. There was a committee there, and we thought maybe they could do something for us, but they couldn't. So we returned to Russia, to Oshana, but we stopped in Korsun where Mime Chai Feige lived.
